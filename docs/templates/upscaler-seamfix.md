# Upscaler Seamfix Module

Like the standard upscaler module, but with seamfixing enabled. This takes
a lot longer to run, but eliminates seams in the upscaled image. It can
be used in the same way as the standard upscaler module.

> I recommend connecting both this and the standard upscaler module to the
> image, and enable the one to use as needed.
